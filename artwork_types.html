      <p class = 'paragraph'>It is evident that prints make up the bulk of the artworks with a count of over 1000,
          followed by photographs which have a count greater than 200. On the other hand, the rest of the artwork types have a significantly lower count,
          with some even approaching zero. This makes sense, as we believe that prints are generally more easily to obtain with respect to paintings or sculptures.
