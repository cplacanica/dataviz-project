      <p class='paragraph'>We can see that there are many interconnections between artists and materials.
		  In some cases, multiple materials are linked together because an artist has used both; in other cases,
		  it is the material that connects more than one artist. It is also evident that there are more prominent clusters,
		  with dozens of nodes connected by a single hub, as well as more solitary nodes because it can happen that a particular material has been used by only one artist.
		  These interconnections between artists and materials suggest that there is a diversity in the types of materials used in creating artworks.
		  This could indicate the artists' willingness to experiment with different materials to achieve their desired artistic expressions.
		  Moreover, the existence of multiple clusters of nodes connected by a single hub could suggest the presence of artistic movements or schools,
		  where artists who are connected by a shared artistic vision or style also tend to use similar materials.
		  Finally, the presence of solitary nodes could indicate the existence of artists who are unique in their choice of materials or who are less connected to artistic movements or schools.
		  It could also suggest the possibility of emerging or less-established artists who are still exploring different materials in their artwork.</p>
