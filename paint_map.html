    <p class = 'paragraph'>From the map, we can see that the majority of painters come from the United States of America.
        This is because of insights obtained from analyzing the museum's collection, which showed a strong representation of American artists.
        As for Europe, the colors on the map are relatively light, except for France, which is not surprising since many famous painters such as Monet,
        Delacroix, Degas, etc. come from there.
        Regarding Asia, most of the artists are Chinese, which is likely due to the vast population of China and the long history of art in the country.</p>
