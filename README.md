# dataviz-project

In this repository you can find the file where we put the plots all together, which is "DataVis Project Final.ipynb". There are also separated files which we pushed along the way for the individual graphs. We also have a separate branch for the website, and another branch "G" which has been used some time for adding other plots. 

The scraping was done with the Art Institute of Chicago Free API, where we scraped all the variables which we wanted to analyse for our analysis. The scraping can be found in the scraping_code.py file, which will scrape the website and then create a csv file called project_dataset.csv.

In the website branch there are all the html files that compose the site, as well as a style.css file for the aesthetics of the site and a javascript dile for the sliding effects of the home page.
