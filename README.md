# dataviz-project

You can find here all the codes for the website and the files or images that must be used. 
The address is: https://cplacanica.github.io/dataviz-project/website.html

The file dash.html should have contained a dashboard, but because I could not deploy our dash online, it only contains a picture, and the dash will be shown separately. To run the dash, in the main branch there is a specific file to run called dash-project.ipynb.
