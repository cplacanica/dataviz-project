		<p class='paragraph'>We can see how, in the first three departments in terms of number of artworks, these works were created relatively recently.
			As for Arts of Asia, it is the only one to have works dating back to before 1300, with only one work from 600-700 and 10 works from 1200-1300. This is not surprising because Asian art is among the oldest in the world, and in fact, we would have expected even older works. Then there is a peak between 1800-1900 with over 400 artworks created.
			As for Photography and Media, production begins around 1300, reaching a peak between 1900-2000, with around 300 artworks.
			In the same period, there is a smaller peak (less than 200 artworks) in the creation of Prints and Drawings, which had been absent in all previous years.
			These two departments represent relatively new art forms, which explains why their production began later compared to Arts of Asia.</p>
