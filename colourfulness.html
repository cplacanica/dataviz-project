      <p class = 'paragraph'>We can see from the plot that for what regards the colorfulness, the artwork type "Photograph" is the one that has lower values.
          We suspect that this might be because in general photographs are also very common in black-and-white or in sepia colors,
          meaning that the colorfulness will be lower than other types of artworks. The type that has the highest values is "Print",
          which not only has higher values, but it is the only one which has values of more than 100. Indeed, contrary to photography,
          prints are frequently in brighter colors. We also have to point out that the observations for Print were more than the ones for the other Artwork Types,
          which might have impacted the distribution of colorfulness. Finally, we were not surprised to see that despite having less observations with respect to the other types,
          "Painting" has, on average, higher values than "Photography" and "Decorative Arts". Moreover, differently from "Print",
          it has no particularly high values, probably because painting in general tends to have an average level of color,
          which is rarely exaggerated due to difficulties in dealing with many strong colors.</p>
