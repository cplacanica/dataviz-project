      <p class = 'paragraph'>After the analysis, we realized that the variables were not strongly correlated with each other.
          This suggests that the level of an artwork's popularity or its access to high-resolution images and multimedia resources are not necessarily related to whether or not it has been viewed much on the museum's website.
          This could mean that other factors may play a more significant role in an artwork's visibility on the website,
          such as the artist's reputation, the artwork's historical significance, or the museum's marketing and outreach efforts.
          These insights highlight the complexity of understanding what drives an artwork's visibility on a museum's website.
          While having high-quality images or multimedia resources can certainly enhance an artwork's online presence,
          other factors such as the artist's reputation, historical significance, or the museum's marketing and outreach efforts may play a more significant role.<br>
          Therefore, museums should consider a range of factors when promoting their collections online,
          and invest in comprehensive strategies that take into account not only the availability of high-quality images and multimedia resources,
          but also the broader cultural and historical significance of the artworks, as well as their potential appeal to different audiences.
          By doing so, museums can ensure that their online collections are both informative and engaging,
          and attract a diverse range of visitors from around the world.</p>
