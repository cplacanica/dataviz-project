	<p class = 'paragraph'>In the histogram, we can observe that the level of colorfulness remains generally below 50 for most of the top five materials,
		with a few notable exceptions, that are better represented in the scatterplot, such as Litograph on paper and Color woodblock print oban.
		Lithography and color woodblock printing are both techniques that allow for the use of multiple colors in the printing process,
		which can contribute to higher levels of colorfulness in the final artwork. In the case of color woodblock print oban,
		it is a specific type of printmaking that often features vibrant colors and intricate designs,
		which may explain its higher level of colorfulness compared to other materials. Additionally,
		these exceptions may indicate that certain artistic traditions or cultures prioritize the use of color in their artwork,
		while others may place greater emphasis on other elements, such as line or texture.
		In the scatterplot, the top five materials are relatively recent, except for Etching on paper, which was used between 1600 and 1970.
		Etching on paper was a popular printmaking technique during that period.
		However, it gradually fell out of favor with artists due to the rise of new printmaking techniques and technologies.
		With the advent of photography and digital printing methods, artists had more options to create their works,
		and the use of traditional etching techniques declined. Considering the colorfulness data,
		it appears that there is a trend of increasing colorfulness in more recent artistic practices.
		This suggests that contemporary artists may be more inclined to use vibrant colors and experiment with color combinations in their works,
		compared to artists from previous time periods.<br><br>
These observations highlight the dynamic relationship between materials, colorfulness, and time period in art,
		underscoring how artistic techniques and styles evolve over time.
		The insights gained from this analysis can inform our understanding of the historical and cultural contexts of different artistic traditions and help us appreciate the unique creative processes and aesthetics of artists from diverse backgrounds.
		<br><br><b>For reference, we report here a brief explanation of the various methods:</b><br>
		- Color woodblock print; oban: a Japanese printmaking technique that involves creating a design on a wooden block, then using the block to print multiple copies of the design. Oban is a specific size of print, typically measuring around 15 x 10 inches.
		- Color woodblock print: a type of printmaking technique that involves creating a design on a wooden block, then using the block to print multiple copies of the design. The term "color" indicates that the print includes multiple colors.<br>
		- Etching on paper: a printmaking technique that involves drawing a design on a metal plate and then using acid to "etch" the design into the plate. Ink is then applied to the plate and transferred to paper through a printing press.<br>
		- Lithograph on paper: a printmaking technique that involves drawing a design on a stone or metal plate using a greasy substance, then applying ink to the plate and transferring the design onto paper through a printing press.<br>
		- Gelatin silver print: a type of black and white photographic print that uses gelatin as the binding agent for the light-sensitive silver salts. It is a common photographic printing technique used in both analog and digital photography.</p>
