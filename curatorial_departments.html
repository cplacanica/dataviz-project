      <p class = 'paragraph'>The distribution of artworks among the various departments indicates that the Art Institute of Chicago has a diverse collection that covers a range of cultures and time periods, with a particular emphasis on Asian art and works on paper.
Additionally, the relatively small number of artworks in some departments, such as Contemporary Art, Textiles, and Modern Art, may suggest that the Art Institute of Chicago prioritizes collecting and displaying historical art over more recent works. This is also confirmed by the presence of departments such as Arts of the Ancient Mediterranean and Byzantium and Applied Arts of Europe, which highlights the Art Institute of Chicago's commitment to preserving and showcasing art from a variety of cultures and historical periods.
It is also interesting to note that the Arts of the Americas and Arts of Africa departments have fewer artworks than some of the other departments. This may reflect a historical bias towards Western art in museums and collections, but it is positive that the Art Institute of Chicago has dedicated departments for these regions and probably in the future will to expand their collections.
Overall, the distribution of artworks among the various departments provides insight into the Art Institute of Chicago's collection and curatorial priorities, which include diversity and inclusivity in terms of cultures and historical periods represented.</p>
