		  This is likely due to the fact that the scraping was done on an archive of works in the museum.
		  It is not surprising that the department with the highest number of artworks on display is Arts of the Americas, probably because the Institute is in America.
		  What is surprising, however, is the presence of European and Ancient Mediterranean and Byzantine artworks,
		  which confirms the museum's commitment to inclusivity and diversity in terms of cultures and historical periods.</p>

      	<p class='paragraph' style='text-align: justify; position: absolute; left: 60%; right: 5%; top: 140%; word-wrap: break-word;'>As for the domain,
			we can notice that the majority of artworks are in the private domain, especially in those departments concerning recent works such as prints or photography,
			or relatively new art forms that have only recently received attention, such as African art.
			The only exceptions are Asian, European, and Ancient Mediterranean and Byzantinium art, but it is not surprising since these are very ancient arts,
			and it is quite obvious that the authors are passed away and the works have become public domain.<br><br><br>
		We made this comparison to see if there could be a relationship between the two variables,
			and in fact, we can see that most of the ancient and therefore public domain works, such as Asian or European,
			are no longer on display, while works of more recent and therefore private art, such as American art, are more prominently displayed.</p>
